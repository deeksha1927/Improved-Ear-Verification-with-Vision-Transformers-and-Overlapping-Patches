This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:
Overlapping Patch Selection for Ear Recognition using Vision Transformers - https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.23275

The code was adapted from - https://github.com/deepinsight/insightface

üîç Summary
We explore ear recognition using Vision Transformers (ViT) enhanced with an overlapping patch strategy to better capture detailed ear structures. The approach significantly improves performance across multiple datasets.

üìà Key Points
Models used: ViT-Tiny, ViT-Small, ViT-Base, ViT-Large

Overlapping patches outperformed non-overlapping in 44/48 experiments
Up to +10% improvement on EarVN1.0
Best performance: 28√ó28 patch size, 14-pixel stride
